## Hello World.

Quite frankly, I don't know what I'll post here. I might post some programming rants, or Rust evangelization, how to's for UE4 & Blender, or maybe just nothing at all.
Maybe the trick is to write a whole bunch of posts to make it seem like I'm smarter than I am and get hired by some multi national organization and retire early.

If you're reading this, and this is still the only post, you probably can guess it's the last one. Oh well, I won't tell anyone.

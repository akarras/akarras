# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Aaron Karras, a software engineer who loves Rust and game development.

## What I do

- ðŸ’» I write Rust code for a living
- ðŸŽ® I made games and tools using Rust, WASM, Unreal, and other frameworks. Some of my projects are:
  - [wall-a-bunga](https://github.com/akarras/wall-a-bunga): A bulk wallpaper downloader written in Rust.
  - [ultros](https://github.com/akarras/ultros): Fast FFXIV marketboard tools. Still heavily WIP
  - [torcurve-rs](https://github.com/akarras/torcurve-rs): A parameterized curve formula for generating lots of different curve shapes useful for easing, etc. Ported from Torcado's JS implementation
- ðŸŽ¨ I created art and music for my game [Stir Party [RIP]](https://stirparty.com) using Blender, Photoshop, and other software.

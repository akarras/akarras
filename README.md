I like low level systems development code. I like game development
and have a now abandoned UE4 game project called [Stir Party](https://stirparty.com)
Professionally, I write C++ code for networking systems.


## Projects

### Bert (BlightBot)
#### Description
Initially called Blight, Bert is my personal Discord bot. I wrote him using Rust after writing a few other hobby bots using node.js. I was impressed by the versatility of [serenity-rs](https://github.com/serenity-rs/serenity) and quickly fell in love with the procedural macros that were defined there that made writing a Discord bot a breeze in a low level language like Rust.
#### Features
* markov - Bert is able to generate markov chains from the current guild's messages or from an entire Discord server
* markov images - Same as the previous feature, but generates a meme image from a Subreddit.

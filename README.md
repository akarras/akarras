## About me

Professionally, I write C++ code for networking systems, but I like game development to flex my artistic side. 
Low level code with C++ and Rust generally consumes all my time, but I have a lot of past experience with C#/WPF from when I was writing Windows Phone apps in my teens, and Java from writing Minecraft plugins back when I ran a Minecraft server for a moderately sized community.

Outside of coding, I'm kind of boring. I like gaming with friends, and going to places warmer than I live to feel alive.

## Projects

### Bert (BlightBot)
#### Brief
Initially called Blight due to the covid-19 pandemic, Bert is my personal Discord bot. I wrote him using Rust after writing a few other hobby bots using node.js. I was impressed by the versatility of [serenity-rs](https://github.com/serenity-rs/serenity) and quickly fell in love with the procedural macros that were defined there that made writing a Discord bot a breeze in a low level language like Rust.
Bert is able to generate markov chains from Discord or Reddit messages, and able to generate memes. Still haven't decided whether to open source the project so others may learn from my mistakes, or to go full corpo and monetize the bot and rule the world. Eh.

#### Technologies
* Rust, async, tokio, serenity-rs, mongo-db

### [Stir Party](https://stirparty.com)
#### Brief
Stir Party is a 8 player online multiplayer party game that I worked on through most of college. It was set to launch on Steam, but has since been put on ice. Not sure I will ever release the title because I just haven't been having fun with it anymore. Maybe one day.
#### Technologies
* UE4, Blender, Substance Painter, C++, Blueprint

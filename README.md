## About me

Professionally, I write C++ code for networking systems, but I like game development to flex my artistic side. 

In the past, I've played with Windows Phone, Android, WPF, JavaScript, TypeScript, Java, Node.js, Vue.js, to in about that order

Outside of coding, I like gaming with friends, eating yummy food with my lovely girlfriend, and long naps on the beach.
